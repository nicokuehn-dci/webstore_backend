# WebStore Application Construction Plan

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** WebStore CLI Application  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Author:** Nico Kuehn  
**Date:** May 27, 2025  

## Purpose and Scope
This document outlines the construction plan for the WebStore CLI Application, a command-line interface for managing an online store with product management, user authentication, and shopping cart functionality. The application features an interactive menu system with arrow key navigation and a color-coded user interface.

## Architecture Overview

### Design Pattern
The application follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability:

- **Models:** Represent data structures and business logic
- **Views:** Handle user interface and display components
- **Controllers:** Manage application flow and connect models with views

```

## Component Details

### Models
1. **User Model** (`src/models/user.py`)
   - Represents user data (regular users and administrators)
   - Attributes: ID, username, password, email, admin status

2. **Product Model** (`src/models/product.py`)
   - Represents product data
   - Attributes: ID, name, price, description, stock, image URL, specifications, ratings, tags

3. **Cart Model** (`src/models/cart.py`)
   - Represents shopping cart functionality
   - Methods: add item, remove item, get items, clear cart

### Views
1. **Menu View** (`src/views/menu.py`)
   - Interactive menu system with keyboard navigation
   - Color-coded interface with selected item highlighting

2. **Admin View** (`src/views/admin_view.py`)
   - Admin interface components
   - Product management screens, reports, settings

3. **Customer View** (`src/views/customer_view.py`)
   - Customer interface components
   - Product browsing, cart management, checkout process

### Controllers
1. **Auth Controller** (`src/controllers/auth_controller.py`)
   - Handles user authentication, registration, and login
   - Manages user data persistence in JSON files

2. **Product Controller** (`src/controllers/product_controller.py`)
   - Manages product operations: create, read, update, delete
   - Handles product search, categorization, and featured lists

3. **Cart Controller** (`src/controllers/cart_controller.py`)
   - Manages shopping cart operations
   - Handles checkout process

4. **Main Controller** (`src/controllers/main_controller.py`)
   - Coordinates application flow
   - Manages navigation between different interfaces

### Utilities
1. **Setup Utilities** (`src/utils/setup.py`)
   - Environment setup functions
   - Dependency management
   - Virtual environment handling

## Data Storage
The application uses JSON files for data persistence:

1. **users.json** - Stores regular user accounts
2. **admins.json** - Stores administrator accounts
3. **products.json** - Stores product data, categories, and featured lists

## User Roles and Permissions
The application supports two user roles:

1. **Regular Users (Customers)**
   - Browse products by category
   - Search for products
   - Add products to cart
   - View and manage cart
   - Checkout

2. **Administrators**
   - All customer capabilities
   - Add, update, and delete products
   - Manage product categories
   - Configure featured products
   - View reports and statistics

## Security Implementation
1. **User Authentication**
   - Password verification (plaintext in the prototype, would use hashing in production)
   - Session management

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access control for admin functions
   - Separation of admin and user data

## User Interface Design
1. **Terminal-Based UI**
   - Uses the `blessed` library for terminal manipulation
   - Arrow key navigation for intuitive menu interaction
   - Color-coded interface with orange highlight for selected items
   - Emoji icons for improved menu readability

2. **Menu Structure**
   - Hierarchical menu system
   - Context-specific submenus
   - Consistent navigation patterns

## Implementation Timeline
1. **Phase 1: Setup and Core Components** (Completed)
   - Project structure setup
   - Core models implementation
   - Basic terminal UI

2. **Phase 2: Controller Implementation** (Completed)
   - Authentication controller
   - Product management
   - Cart functionality

3. **Phase 3: Refactoring and Modularization** (Completed)
   - Restructure into MVC pattern
   - Separate admin and user interfaces
   - Improve code organization

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Documentation** (In Progress)
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Documentation updates
   - Code cleanup

## Future Enhancements
1. **Security Improvements**
   - Password hashing and salting
   - Input validation and sanitization

2. **Feature Additions**
   - Order history tracking
   - User profile management
   - Inventory alerts

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Improved product display
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Theme customization

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Terminal with color support
- Dependencies:
  - blessed==1.21.0
  - wcwidth==0.2.13

## Conclusion
This construction plan outlines the architecture, components, and implementation details for the WebStore CLI Application. The modular MVC structure provides a solid foundation for future enhancements while maintaining code quality and developer productivity.
